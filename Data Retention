Subscription Retention
In the term of an active subscription, a subscriber can access, extract, or delete customer data stored in Microsoft 365. If a paid subscription ends or is terminated, Microsoft retains customer data stored in Microsoft 365 in a limited-function account for 90 days to enable the subscriber to extract the data. After the 90-day retention period ends, Microsoft disables the account and deletes the customer data. No more than 180 days after expiration or termination of a subscription to Microsoft 365, Microsoft disables the account and deletes all customer data from the account. Once the maximum retention period for any data has elapsed, the data is rendered commercially unrecoverable.

For a free trial, your account moves into a grace status for 30 days in most countries and regions. During this grace period, you can purchase Microsoft 365. If you decide not to buy Microsoft 365, you can either cancel your trial or let the grace period expire, and your trial account information and data is deleted.
