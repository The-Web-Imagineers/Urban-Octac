Microsoft Event Code of Conduct
Microsoft’s mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more. This includes all Microsoft events and gatherings, including on digital platforms and in person, where we seek to create a respectful, friendly, enjoyable, and inclusive experience for all participants.

 ​

We expect all event participants to uphold the principles of this Code of Conduct. The Code of Conduct applies to all aspects of the main event and any related activities, whether digital or in person. Microsoft does not tolerate the following in any aspect of the event program, including business and social activities:

Behavior that is disruptive, disrespectful, or degrading to others, including any messages, images, or interactions by anyone, in any form, regardless of location.​
Harassment or discrimination based on age, ancestry, color, gender identity or expression, national origin, physical or mental disability, religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected by applicable local laws, regulations, and ordinances.​
 ​

We encourage everyone to assist in creating a welcoming and safe environment. Please report any concerns, harassing behavior, or suspicious or disruptive activity to venue staff, the event host or owner, or the nearest event staff.

 ​

We also encourage everyone to contact Microsoft’s Business Conduct Hotline at any time if you feel anything or anyone is not following this Code of Conduct or is inconsistent with Microsoft’s culture. The Hotline is available regardless of whether you are a Microsoft employee and can be reached at buscond@microsoft.com or +1 (877) 320-MSFT, or call collect outside the United States at +1 (720)-904-6844.  Microsoft employees can also report any concerns to their Microsoft Manager.

 

Microsoft reserves the right to refuse admittance to or remove any person from a Microsoft event at any time at its sole discretion.
